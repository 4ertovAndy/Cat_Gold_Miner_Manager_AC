The autoclicker atomically activates the "dancing cat(x2 boost)
and the managers at the mines. 
===============================================================================
The autoclicker works on the basis of machine vision using the OpenCV library, emitting your taps on the screen in the necessary coordinates... for the autoclicker to work, you must have Python v 3.8 and higher, all the necessary additional libraries are in the file requirements.txt
===============================================================================
If you have any questions
about the operation of the autoclicker, write to me in

I will be glad of any help to improve the work of this project and other projects.
